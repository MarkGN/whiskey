BATTLE
=======

Battles are divided into phases.

1. The GM describes the situation: the environment, any enemies, any allies, and anything else of importance.

2. Players declare what their characters will try to do for the next few moments. Typical options are to advance, stand ground, or use spells/other special abilities.

The GM may give additional information or ask for clarification. For example, if a player advances and there are two enemies in the way, they may be asked which they would prefer to engage.

3. Attacking characters are paired off into *clashes*. Multiple characters may attack the same enemy, who clashes with each of them.

4. All players, and the GM on behalf of NPCs, perform any *checks* necessary.

5. The GM describes what happens and notes changes in game state such as loss of HP. All characters are assumed to act at the same time.

6. If hostilities continue, go to 2.

Example
-------

GM: "Princess Alyssa, Sir Bobdor, as you make your way through the woods, suddenly, three generic Tolkienesque goblins jump out and rush at you. One has a sword, the other two axes. Alyssa, what do you do?"

A: "Draw my sword and charge the one with the sword."

GM: "Bobdor?"

B: "Charge one with an axe I guess."

GM: "Okay, both of you engage a goblin, and the other axe goblin flanks Bobdor. You both check, and I check for the extra goblin."

*A gets a 14, B 25, and GM 8. In all cases, a value of between 19 and 23 is necessary to pass, so only B passes*

GM: "Alyssa, you move forward to engage the goblin. It opens with a flurry of aggressive slashes. You parry and press forward, but it's quicker than it looks and lands a followup swipe into your thigh. Take 4 damage. Bobdor, you see the two goblins charging you and react. You rush one, lock blades, and kick it in the head, sending it reeling. *knocks off 3 HP* The second goblin comes at you; you hop back out of range of its hack, smack its blade back, and land a deep cut against its chest. *knocks off 6 HP* It stumbles back and screeches defiantly, but it's badly bloodied. What now?"

=======
CLASH
=======

When two characters fight, a clash is initiated. One character performs a *check* of their combat stat against the opponent's combat. If the check passes, that character successfully hits the opponent; if they fail, the opponent hits them. Only one check is performed, preferably the character attacking, or one controlled by a player, but it doesn't make a big mechanical difference.

This is in contrast to d20, where a failed check means you miss, but your opponent may then miss too. Such a check means "Does this specific attack connect". A Whiskey check is rather conceptualised as "Which of us will land the next hit": if it's not you, it's the other guy. Currently, there exist no rules allowing mutual hits.

The duration of a check is indeterminate, and may be narrated at GM discretion. Typically it will last a few seconds.

=======
CHECK
=======

To perform a check of X vs Y, draw a card from your *deck*. Call this number C, and let V = X+C. If V > Y+13, the check passes; otherwise, it fails. Either way, the value V is used further. If C is 26, the check always passes, and if C is 1, it always fails.

Characters have a damage stat composed of two parts, a fixed number and any amount of 'mod' numbers. Both are used whenever that character inflicts damage. When a check is used to decide a clash, the damage is equal to the fixed part plus the sum of (V modulo p) for p in their mod numbers.

-------
Example
-------

Charlie has combat=10, fixed=3, and mod=[3,4]. They draw a 19, for V=29, against an opponent with combat 10. This implies Charlie only needs to beat 23, so he lands the next hit. Damage inflicted is (fixed + 29 mod 3 + 29 mod 4) = (3 + 2 + 1) = 6.

=======
DECK
=======

Each faction (the players, friendly NPCs, enemies) should have their own deck of cards. If you use standard playing decks with no jokers, assign a value of 1 to an ace up to 13 to a king, and +13 if the suit is red. Each card should therefore have a number from 1 to 26. Once a card is drawn, it should be left discarded until the deck is empty, then reshuffled in.

A player should only draw from their deck for a check they want to succeed; otherwise, reword the check or have an enemy perform it. The idea is that a player's good and bad luck should cancel out, which won't happen if the players draw all the low cards and the enemies draw all the high ones.

I suggest splitting each deck into two halves, each with the values 1 through 26. When one half is used up, reshuffle that one and use the other. This way, action shouldn't block on shuffling, and the odds of extreme good or bad luck are even lower.
