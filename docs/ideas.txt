This is a file of appealing ideas I'd like to test or develop mechanics for.

=======
Variable-length rounds
=======

Remember Darth Maul vs Qui-gon and Obi-wan, how DM kicked OW away and soloed QG awhile, killing him? I currently don't have a great way of implementing that, and I think it could be good for major boss fights. It would have sucked if QG had won, "Hey thanks for cheerleading, Obi," but it turned out well.

=======
XP
=======

I've played D&D and White Wolf and mostly preferred the latter, growth-wise. One issue with the former is very thick levels that do a lot of things. I'd prefer more frequent, less impactful levels. A wizard's level 3 "Here's access to level 2 spells and 2 slots for them and +1 level 1 slot and +1 prepared spell and 2 new spells" could be split up into 5 separate purchases and upgrades of slots and 4 more for the spells, prep, and access; you could have a constant trickle of XP and gain something new every session. I think it'd be more fun, and more immersive: rather than your character being engulfed in yellow light and Ascending, they get a little fitter every day.

However, I'm not sure how to do White Wolf's style while also encouraging/enforcing specialisation. Partly this is because Whiskey doesn't really have specialisation ("My character has high combat" "Oh hey, mine too"), which it might if I added social mechanics (which I'm reluctant to do) or other noncombat rules. So I was thinking of adding like Tank/Striker/Leader/Controller builds, specials that favour one role or another.

But I need to workshop doing these in such a way that balance doesn't go crazy. Power is exponential in combat, loosely, so the XP cost for that should be exponential, I guess, if it's possible to buy at all. We want strikers to be able to buy damage more cheaply than tanks can, for example, and tanks to buy HP more cheaply. We could have separate spell paths, like you can only buy a level k+1 spell of any of those roles if you have a level k spell; so because you can only cast one spell at a time, better to specialise and have access to the top-level stuff, with maybe a few cross-class utility spells? I also don't really hate the notion of generalists, except that it'd be nice if not all characters looked basically the same. Compared with d20, a character with good defence and one with good offence are much less differentiated.

In D&D, a level 5 fighter has roughly 2.5* the DPS of a level 1, and 2.5* the HP, and probably a little more armour by virtue of buying splint/plate/whatever and finding magic items. So 4 levels to *=2.5, suggesting +30% per level or so. OTOH, each successive level seems to do more than the previous: other than HP and gold, l2 just gives action surge, once per combat; l3 gives improved crits worth about +6% DPS; l4 gives ~+20% DPS, +1 to-hit being worth +10% and +1 damage being about +9%; and l5 gives 2 attacks per round, fully doubling it, which seems a ludicrous power spike.

Casters are harder to gauge because of how spells scale. I guess l5 fireball is worth about 2.5 l1 burning hands. The rogue begins at 3+d6+(d6 if sneak); approxing d6 as 3 and assuming crits, he has 9 -> 9 -> 12 -> 13 (+1 to-hit) -> 16 (+2 to-hit), comparable to 21, so again, about 2.5*, here with a somewhat smoother progression.

A better question, though, is what I want for this. Suppose we declare players should get 1000XP in a session, scaling for their level. What does that actually mean? SGOTI advocates 2+ sessions per new ability, one for players to learn it, one to exploit it; but that's for D&D, where each level entails multiple new abilities. In Whiskey, a lot of the benefits of XP is simply increasing stats. Maybe, per session, players could get alternately +1 to some stat or learn a new ability?

-------

One point that's bothered me a little is a lack of granularity with the combat stat. In d20, suppose you have characters with 11 AC and +0 to-hit, ie each has 50% to hit any other. If one gets +3 AC and +3 to-hit, it now gets just under 2 hits to its opponents' 1. Under Whiskey, that same almost-2:1 ratio is from +4 combat. In other words, the d20 GM can hand out 6 separate +1 boons, whereas the Whiskey GM only 4. (Under d20, you might do the same from +5 AC and no to-hit, which is fewer boons and slower combat. You might also do +7 to-hit and +1 AC, for as many as 8 boons and faster combat, if still not as fast as Whiskey.)

I'd like to be able to give out a constant trickle of small advances, so it would be nice to subdivide this. Of course, buying +1 HP is always an option; rather than the fighter getting 7 HP per level and levelling once per 3 sessions, give him +2 HP per session. However, +1 combat is intrinsically a pretty big deal. I don't want players to feel like it'd be too big an investment.

Proposal: to split it up by case, viz by having 3 separate feats, "+1 when clashing 1v1, +1 when outnumbering, +1 when outnumbered". Once a player has all 3, they're incorporated into a flat +1 combat bonus. Now we have 12 boons. As long as each of these has an independent and exp-cost progression, most players will keep all 3 more or less in lockstep.

-------

D20 also has a lot of extra rules doing basically the same thing. Fighters get improved critical, critting on a nat 19 -- okay, but the result of that is usually just a modest damage bonus, so why not just give a modest damage bonus? Could it be that the extra rule is fun somehow? Certainly I could add such rules, possibly as advances at high XP; I'm not inclined to without playtesting, because it'd complicate and slow down the game, and unless it specifically seems like it'd be fun, I'd sooner just add a modest damage bonus.

It could be something like people getting addicted to slot machines because of occasional big payouts. Not sure that's a healthy thing to aspire to though.

MORE TRAITS
=======

Because more => more variety. Of course, it can mean information overload for a mechanic that isn't actually very important if they're all balanced, and I already have the simple ones, so these new ideas maybe belong in an expansion set.

Clever/resourceful: "learns" an opponent's style during battle; combat increases every other turn to a max of +2.

Nerdy: knows an additional spell.

Noncombat traits: not really meaningful here since this is a combat engine. Still, I think it might be good to have for a complete game, because I think D&D is so focused on combat mechanics that it forces stories to be combat-heavy (or rather, primes the DM to design them that way) (calling him a DM rather than GM doesn't help), which means more social games become harder if not impossible to run. It would be simpler to learn if Whiskey's combat mechanics were adapted for social tasks ("I try to seduce her." "Okay, but it'll trigger a clash: if you fail, she doesn't just ignore you, she tells her friends you're a creep too.") (that's actually not a bad idea), although there's something to be said for keeping combat and social modular.

=======
GEAR
=======

An ammunition mechanic, where you can sink small amounts of money into consumable items that give one-off tactical boosts. I'm picturing grenades, RWBY's dust rounds, that sort of thing. The text would be along the lines of "Use enhanced ammo for a more powerful attack. Consume for +2 combat ueot."

=======
SPELLS
=======

One issue with D&D combat is that, absent special abilities, optimal play is so often "I use my most powerful attack against whichever enemy is nearest", although to be fair more complex encounters might mitigate this. Even with special abilities, optimal play is often trivially just to nova it in round 1: might as well use action surge/etc right away and eliminate one enemy to reduce their DPS, rather than hold it in reserve. I'd like abilities a little more interesting than that.

Capture the flag/leitmotif: you capture the flag. Whoever has the flag gets +3. If 2 or more agents try to capture the flag at the same time, one wins at random. No agent may use this ability more than once per battle. The flag is reset at end of battle.
-- might not work: if you both know the other party has this ability, optimal strategy is never to use it. Only worth using if you think the opponent doesn't have it, or as many uses of it as you.

Charge up: if the battle has lasted n rounds so far, gain +n ueob; so you want to use it halfway through

*Fury: gain +(max_hp - current-hp) ueob or ueot, where the bonus is evaluated at use and not updated; so you want to use it half-ish way through, and you also maybe don't always want to heal after every fight

*Sniper: pay mana now and charge up for a turn or two. If interrupted, clash with the interloper at -3 combat. On the third turn, unleash a devastating barrage: either single target, or less damage to multiple targets.

Souldrinker: if you kill an enemy this turn, recover 5 HP.

Swansong: if a character's avatar is about to die, in a context where this entails catastrophic mission failure, then, depending on context and GM discretion, they may use Swansong. Their body is fully restored and given a massive combat buff; however, this is powered by life force of the character, not the avatar, and results in character permadeath. The avatar lasts just long enough to complete this current battle, then loses cohesion. This is always by choice: is this quest important enough to trade in the character? If so, the result is either a heroic sacrifice, or a significantly more badass final boss, now with the scalp of a player character. If used, recommended BGM is Undertale's Battle Against A True Hero.

Vampirism: on a hit, recover 1hp

NONCOMBAT MECHANICS
=======

I wrote above that social checks would trigger clashes, but that's not true. A clash formally means 2 agents are trying to do mutually exclusive things, often hitting the other while protecting themselves. No clash is triggered if one is immobile or doesn't fight back, for example; it's assumed a character can hit a training dummy without tripping over their own feet 1 time in 20.

Suppose you want to run a game where boy PCs can ask girl NPCs out. (I've played/run 3 games with (attempted) seduction, so as creepy as the question is, it's not unreasonable.) In combat, there's a fairly intuitive ordering of better to worse, in that a better fighter is both harder to kill and better at killing (even if you separate armour and to-hit stats, there's still HP*expected_DPS/expected_incoming_DPS: a well-armoured fighter is good at killing because he'll last long enough to keep trying); but you might have some girls who just aren't interested, so they're hard to ask out, but they're not particularly good at asking anyone else out themselves.

This suggests that maybe I should reframe the question. If a girl wants to go out with someone, no clash is triggered, because the two parties have coaligned interests. If she has other plans, no amount of PC charm will be effective. The fun is if she's ambivalent: if she'd like a date, but she has high standards that the PC may or may not meet. If the PC declares, "I talk her into going home with me," the issue is that that isn't mutually exclusive with her "I don't go home with just anyone." She doesn't not want to go home with them; and if they try to convince her that they meet her standards, she doesn't not want to believe they meet her standards.

I feel like a clash simply isn't the right mindset. That's for two agents with mutually exclusive objectives. Social interactions don't have mutual exclusion; they're more about trust, about deciding whether you believe the other person or your interests really are coaligned. I guess you could model it as convincingness = charisma + sincerity + d26, checked against an arbitrary scepticism value that she can set as high as she likes. The problem with this idea is that there's no mechanic by which a high-level NPC could distinguish charisma from reality.

What I'd really want is something such that a PC's odds increase with his charisma; sincerity; the girl's interest; and her talent as a judge of character. Maybe clash min(charisma, interest) + min(sincerity, judge of character) vs standards?
