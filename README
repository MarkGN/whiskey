Files for the Whiskey system, a set of rules designed for tabletop RPGs in the vein of D&D.

Notable differences include:
* Use of cards for checks;
* Emphasis of checks whose failure results in negative consequences, rather than null consequences, in particular the clashing mechanic, wherein a failed attack means the opponent scores a hit, rather than merely a miss;
* Batched turns, wherein all players declare their actions before any are resolved;
* Damage is rolled at the same time as a check and used by whichever party wins.

This has had limited testing via the Roll20 platform. Feedback is very welcome.
